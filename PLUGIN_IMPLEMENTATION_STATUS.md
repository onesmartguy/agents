## Priority Order for Implementation

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **react-development** - Most commonly used
2. **nextjs-development** - Popular framework
3. **dotnet-development** - Modern .NET development
4. **tailwind-styling** - Used across React/Next.js

### Medium Priority (Specialized)
5. **react-native-development** - Mobile development
6. **react-native-expo** - Expo-specific workflows
7. **playwright-testing** - E2E testing

### Lower Priority (Legacy)
8. **dotnet-framework** - Legacy support

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach 1: Vertical Slice (Recommended)
Complete one plugin entirely before moving to the next:
1. Create all agents for plugin
2. Create command for plugin
3. Create all skills for plugin
4. Test plugin end-to-end
5. Move to next plugin

**Pros:** Faster to working state, easier to test, can release incrementally
**Cons:** Slower to get broad coverage

### Approach 2: Horizontal Layer
Complete all agents first, then all commands, then all skills:
1. Write all 16 agents
2. Write all 8 commands
3. Write all 38 skills
4. Test everything

**Pros:** Can establish patterns easily, consistency across plugins
**Cons:** Nothing fully working until the end

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Recommended for this scope)
Complete high-priority plugins vertically, then fill in others:
1. react-development (complete)
2. nextjs-development (complete)
3. dotnet-development (complete)
4. Complete remaining 5 plugins
5. Testing and documentation phase

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ‚úÖ Directory structures created
2. üîÑ Update marketplace.json with plugin entries
3. Create 1-2 complete example agents to establish pattern
4. Create 1 complete skill to establish pattern
5. Create 1 complete command to establish pattern
6. Use examples as templates for remaining components
