## Style Hybrid Strategies

Combine multiple styles effectively:

### Strategy 1: Primary + Secondary
**Approach**: One primary style, secondary accents

Example: "Manga (primary) + Western comic ink lines (secondary)"

Platform Implementation:
- Midjourney: "manga style with western comic [element]"
- ComfyUI: Main LoRA 0.9, secondary LoRA 0.4-0.5
- Gemini: "manga illustration with [western element]"
- Firefly: Use Manga filter, add western detail in text

### Strategy 2: Era Mashup
**Approach**: Combine styles from different eras

Example: "Golden Age (1940s) + Modern color grading"

Platform Implementation:
- Describe Golden Age style, add "with modern photography color grading"
- Adjust LoRA weights to balance eras
- Use both era-specific and modern descriptive language

### Strategy 3: Cultural Blend
**Approach**: Combine manga with western or European

Example: "Manga meets French Ligne Claire"

Platform Implementation:
- Use both style LoRAs or descriptions
- ComfyUI: (manga_lora:0.7), (ligne_claire_lora:0.6)
- Midjourney: "manga-influenced ligne claire style"
- Gemini: "manga-inspired European comic aesthetic"

### Strategy 4: Mood Overlay
**Approach**: Base style + atmospheric mood

Example: "Western comic noir atmosphere"

Platform Implementation:
- Primary style + mood descriptors
- Use lighting and color vocabulary for mood
- Adjust CFG/stylization for mood strength

## Example Prompt Generation
