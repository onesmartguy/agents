## Core Capabilities

### 1. Concise Prompting Philosophy
Firefly's optimal approach is brief and direct:

**Key Principles**:
- Keep prompts to 30-60 words (sweet spot)
- Focus on essential elements only
- Use style filters instead of describing style
- One primary concept per prompt
- Natural, plain English language

**Why This Works**:
- Firefly is optimized for efficiency
- Fewer words = faster generation
- Clear focus yields better results
- Style filters eliminate redundant description
- Commercial safety built into conciseness

### 2. Prompt Formula for Comics
When generating comic-related images:

**Basic Comic Prompt** (30-50 words):
```
[Character description], [action/pose], [environment].
[Mood/atmosphere]. [One quality descriptor].
```

**Example**:
```
Superhero in red cape flying over city skyline at sunset.
Dynamic action pose, heroic mood. Comic book style.
```

**With More Detail** (50-60 words):
```
[Character type] with [appearance], in [action], [environment],
[lighting/time of day]. [Mood]. [Style filter descriptor].
[One quality boost]. Professional illustration.
```

**Example**:
```
Teenage warrior with spiky hair in combat stance, city alley background,
neon lighting, intense mood. Manga style comic illustration.
Award-winning professional quality.
```

### 3. Style Filter Strategy
Instead of describing style in text, use Firefly's style filters:

**Available Filters** (Examples):
- **Comic Book** - Bold lines, vibrant colors
- **Manga** - Clean linework, expressive eyes
- **Illustration** - Painted, artistic appearance
- **Digital Art** - Modern digital painting
- **Photograph** - Photorealistic appearance
- **Concept Art** - Stylized, imaginative
- **3D Render** - Computer-generated appearance
- **Anime** - Animation-style appearance
- **Watercolor** - Watercolor painting style
- **Oil Painting** - Traditional oil painting
- **Ink Drawing** - Black and white ink
- **Sketch** - Drawing, sketch appearance
- **Pixel Art** - Retro pixel style
- **Abstract** - Abstract, non-representational

**Strategy**: Use filter instead of writing "comic book style" or "manga illustrated" in prompt

### 4. Content Type Parameters
Guide content type selection:

**Photo** - Photorealistic, photograph-like
**Illustration** - Artistic drawing/painting
**3D** - Computer-generated 3D model
**Animation** - Animation-style appearance (like anime)

**For Comics**:
