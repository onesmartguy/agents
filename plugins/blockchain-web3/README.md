```

## Agents Reference

This plugin provides **1 specialized agents**:

### blockchain-developer

**Model:** sonnet - Complex reasoning and architecture decisions

**Purpose:** Build production-ready Web3 applications, smart contracts, and decentralized systems. Implements DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, DAOs, and enterprise blockchain integrations. Use PROACTIVELY for smart contracts, Web3 apps, DeFi protocols, or blockchain infrastructure.

**When to Use Proactively:**
- Build production-ready Web3 applications, smart contracts, and decentralized systems
- When you need specialized blockchain developer expertise

**Example Invocation:**
```bash
@blockchain-developer <specific task or question>
```

## Skills Reference

This plugin includes **4 progressive disclosure skills** for advanced patterns:

### defi-protocol-templates

### Differences from Similar Plugins

The `blockchain-web3` plugin focuses specifically on smart contract development with solidity, defi protocol implementation, nft platforms, and web3 application architecture, while similar plugins may have broader or different specializations.

### Works Well With


### Integration Patterns

- **Sequential workflows:** Chain multiple agents for complex tasks
- **Parallel execution:** Run independent agents simultaneously
- **Context sharing:** Maintain state across agent interactions

## Best Practices

### Do's

- Use `@blockchain-developer` for primary tasks in this domain
- Follow the plugin's specialized patterns for blockchain
- Leverage progressive disclosure skills for advanced features
- Combine with complementary plugins for full-stack workflows

### Don'ts

- Don't use this plugin for tasks outside its domain
- Avoid mixing incompatible plugin patterns
- Don't skip the recommended workflow steps

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-complexity:** Start simple, add features incrementally
2. **Wrong agent:** Use the right agent for the task
3. **Missing context:** Provide sufficient background information

### Optimization Tips

- Use progressive disclosure to load only needed knowledge
- Cache agent responses when appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Agent not responding as expected

**Solution:**
- Verify plugin installation
- Check agent name spelling
- Provide more context in your request

**Issue:** Skill not activating

**Solution:**
- Ensure trigger criteria match your use case
- Explicitly mention the skill in your request

### Error Messages


| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Agent not found | Plugin not installed | Verify installation |
| Skill unavailable | Path mismatch | Check skill directory structure |
| Command failed | Missing dependencies | Review prerequisites |

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Verbose mode:** Request detailed explanations from agents
2. **Step-by-step:** Break complex tasks into smaller steps
3. **Isolation:** Test agents individually before combining
