## Story Development Process

### 1. Concept Phase

**Brainstorm Ideas:**
- What's the tech/parenting/family situation?
- What's the comedic or emotional hook?
- How do Em, E, and P each contribute?
- What's the lesson or theme (if any)?

**Examples:**
- "E tries to teach Em about version control using household chores"
- "Em builds an AI assistant that starts mimicking E's dad jokes"
- "P accidentally deploys E's experimental smart home system"

### 2. Beat Sheet Creation

Transform concept into 10-beat structure:
- Ensure each beat has clear purpose
- Balance comedy with heart
- Give each character a moment
- Visual opportunities in every beat
- Pacing: Fast setup, escalating middle, satisfying end

### 3. Dialogue Writing

**Character Voice Guidelines:**

**E's Dialogue:**
```
✓ "Alright, let me merge your request with reality..."
✓ "I think we can debug this situation."
✓ "Your old man's got a PR for that."
✗ "Indeed, daughter, I comprehend your distress."
✗ Too formal, too stiff
```

**Em's Dialogue:**
```
✓ "W dad... this is actually kinda fire."
✓ "Father, that's a hard no."
✓ "Okay but hear me out—"
✗ "Father, I believe your hypothesis is incorrect."
✗ Too formal, not kid-like
```

**P's Communication:**
```
✓ [Thought bubble: "Treats?"]
✓ [Action: Knocks over server rack]
✓ [Expression: Eyes wide, tail wagging chaos]
✗ Complex thoughts (keep simple, dog-focused)
```

### 4. Visual Storytelling

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- Facial expressions over exposition
- Environmental storytelling (posters, tech setup)
- Visual gags in background
- Color shifts for mood changes

**Panel Variety:**
- Establish shots (wide): Setting, multiple characters
- Medium shots: Conversation, interaction
- Close-ups: Emotion, reaction
- Extreme close-ups: Comedy, emphasis
- Dynamic angles: Action, energy

## Theme Integration

### Common Themes for Em & E

**Technology & Family:**
- Balance between screen time and real connection
- Teaching tech concepts through parenting
- How technology brings people together (or apart)

**Parent-Child Relationships:**
- Mutual respect despite age gap
- Learning from each other
- Finding common ground

**Problem-Solving:**
- Creative solutions to everyday problems
- Collaboration over individual effort
- Failure as learning opportunity

**Identity & Growth:**
- Em finding her voice
- E learning to be a better dad
- P being chaotic good

## Episode Planning Workflow

```javascript
// Step 1: Concept
const concept = {
  title: "The Commit-ment Issue",
  logline: "E teaches Em about git commits using her reluctance to commit to weekend plans",
  theme: "Small consistent efforts beat perfect plans",
  genre: "tech-comedy"
}

// Step 2: Character Arcs
const arcs = {
  E: "Learns that teaching requires meeting kids where they are",
  Em: "Discovers that committing to small decisions isn't scary",
  P: "Accidentally commits catastrophic changes (comic relief)"
}

// Step 3: Beat Sheet
// [Create full 10-beat structure]

// Step 4: Script Conversion
// Transform beats into dialogue and action
```

## Script Format

```markdown
# Episode: [Title]

## PAGE 1

**PANEL 1** (Wide Establish)
SETTING: Suburban garage, dusk, garage door half-open
CHARACTERS: E at laptop, Em on phone, P chewing cable
CAPTION: Saturday, 6pm. Decision time.

E: So... movie night or game night?

**PANEL 2** (Medium on Em)
Em rolls eyes, doesn't look up from phone.

EM: I dunno. Whatever.

**PANEL 3** (Close on E, thoughtful)
E: Hmm. That's like a git commit with no message.

**PANEL 4** (Medium two-shot)
EM: (looks up, confused) ...what?

E: (grinning) Oh, let me explain version control through your weekend anxiety.

## PAGE 2

## Integration with Production Pipeline

### Handoff to Storyboard Artist

After beat sheet and script are approved:
1. Provide beat sheet with timing
2. Provide dialogue script
3. Note key visual moments
4. Specify character emotions per panel
5. Suggest camera angles for emphasis

### Handoff to Character Designer

For new characters or props:
1. Physical description
2. Personality traits
3. Color palette preferences
4. Outfit anchor points
5. Reference images or style notes

### MCP Integration

Use story development tools:

```javascript
// 1. Create beat sheet
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__create_beat_sheet({
  episodeId: "commit-ment-issue",
  premise: "E teaches Em about git commits using her reluctance to commit to weekend plans",
  targetDuration: 300,  // 5 minutes
  genre: "comedy",
  characters: ["em", "e"]
})

// 2. Draft script from beat sheet
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__draft_script({
  episodeId: "commit-ment-issue",
  beatSheetPath: "episodes/commit-ment-issue/content/beat_sheet.md",
  characterVoices: {
    "em": "curious, enthusiastic, sometimes frustrated",
    "e": "patient, technical, encouraging"
  }
})

// 3. Validate story structure
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__validate_story({
  episodeId: "commit-ment-issue"
})

// 4. Export for review
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__export_story({
  episodeId: "commit-ment-issue",
  format: "pdf",
  includeNotes: true
})
```

- **Visual Storytelling:** Film language in comics

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Character**: What does each character want/need this episode?
2. **Visual First**: Think in images, not just dialogue
3. **Economy**: Every beat must move story or develop character
4. **Authenticity**: Draw from real parent-child dynamics
5. **Tech Accuracy**: If using tech concepts, get them right
6. **Humor Balance**: Comedy should enhance, not undermine emotion
7. **Rewrites**: First draft is discovery, polish in rewrites
8. **Read Aloud**: Dialogue should sound natural spoken
