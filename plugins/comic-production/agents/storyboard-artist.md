## Beat Sheet → Shotlist Conversion

### Conversion Process

**Input**: Beat sheet with 10 beats
**Output**: 20-40 shots across 12 pages

**Ratio**: 2-4 shots per beat (some beats need more coverage)

### Example Conversion

**Beat 3 - INCITING INCIDENT (1:00-1:30 / Page 2)**
```
Beat Description:
"P knocks over coffee onto E's laptop. Screen goes black. E panics."
```

**Converted to Shots:**

**Result**: Single beat → 4 shots with escalating tension, reaction, and aftermath

## Camera Language

### Shot Types

**Extreme Wide / Establishing (EWS)**
- Purpose: Establish location, show scale
- When: Opening shots, location changes, epic moments
- Framing: Characters small in environment
- Example: "Entire garage exterior, car in driveway, door half-open"

**Wide Shot (WS)**
- Purpose: Show full scene, multiple characters
- When: Group conversations, action sequences, context
- Framing: Full bodies visible, environment clear
- Example: "E and Em at garage workbench, tools and equipment visible"

**Medium-Wide (MWS)**
- Purpose: Balance character and environment
- When: Two-person scenes, establishing character in space
- Framing: Waist-up or knees-up
- Example: "E at laptop, P beside him, garage background visible"

**Medium Shot (MS)**
- Purpose: Conversation, character interaction
- When: Dialogue scenes, reactions
- Framing: Waist-up
- Example: "E and Em talking, upper bodies and faces clear"

**Medium Close-Up (MCU)**
- Purpose: Focus on character, show emotion
- When: Important dialogue, emotional beats
- Framing: Chest-up
- Example: "Em speaking, face and upper torso, emotion visible"

**Close-Up (CU)**
- Purpose: Capture emotion, emphasis
- When: Key emotional moments, important reactions
- Framing: Head and shoulders
- Example: "E's face as he realizes the problem"

**Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**
- Purpose: Detail, intensity, comedy
- When: Dramatic reveals, comedy emphasis, object focus
- Framing: Part of face or specific object
- Example: "E's eye widening in realization"

### Camera Angles

**Eye-Level**
- Neutral perspective
- Most common, comfortable for viewer
- Use: General scenes, neutral emotional tone

**High Angle (Looking Down)**
- Makes subject appear smaller, vulnerable, weak
- Use: Character defeated, overwhelmed, innocent

**Low Angle (Looking Up)**
- Makes subject appear larger, powerful, heroic
- Use: Character triumphant, intimidating, empowered

**Dutch Angle (Tilted)**
- Creates unease, disorientation, chaos
- Use: Danger, confusion, comedy chaos, dream sequences

**Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**
- Shows perspective, conversation
- Use: Dialogue scenes, POV moments

**Bird's Eye (Overhead)**
- Shows layout, organization, patterns
- Use: Planning scenes, map views, chaos from above

**Worm's Eye (Extreme Low)**
- Dramatic power, emphasis
- Use: Hero moments, intimidation, awe

### Composition Rules

**Rule of Thirds**
```
Grid overlay:
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  •  │     │  •  │  Power points at intersections
├─────┼─────┼─────┤  Place subjects at these points
│  •  │     │  •  │  Horizon on top or bottom third
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  •  │     │  •  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```
- Place important elements at intersection points
- Horizon line on top or bottom third
- Creates balanced, professional composition

**Leading Lines**
- Use environmental elements to guide eye
- Examples: Roads, fences, arms pointing, eye gaze
- Lead viewer to subject or focal point

**Framing Within Frame**
- Use doorways, windows, objects to frame subject
- Creates depth and focus
- Example: E framed by garage door opening

**Symmetry**
- Balanced left/right composition
- Use for: Formal moments, confrontations, emphasis
- Example: E and Em facing each other, centered

**Asymmetry**
- Unbalanced composition for tension or movement
- Use for: Action, dynamic moments, unease
- Example: Character far left, empty space right suggests movement

**Depth**
- Foreground, midground, background elements
- Creates 3D feel in 2D panel
- Example: P in foreground, E in midground, garage equipment background

## Panel Flow & Page Layout

### Page Composition

**Standard Comic Page Layout (6-8 panels)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐   │  Panel 1 (Wide establish)
│  │         PANEL 1         │   │
│  └─────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐   │  Panels 2-3 (Action/reaction)
│  │  PANEL 2  │ │  PANEL 3  │   │
│  └───────────┘ └───────────┘   │
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐   │  Panel 4 (Medium shot)
│  │         PANEL 4         │   │
│  └─────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐   │  Panels 5-7 (Quick sequence)
│  │PAN 5 │ │PAN 6 │ │PAN 7 │   │
│  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘   │
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐   │  Panel 8 (Punchline/reveal)
│  │         PANEL 8         │   │
│  └─────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Reading Flow**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom (Western comics)

### Dynamic Layouts

**Action Page (4-6 panels)**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌─────┐ ┌───────────────────┐ │  Varied panel sizes
│  │  1  │ │                   │ │  for visual interest
│  └─────┘ │         2         │ │
│  ┌─────┐ │                   │ │  Larger panel = more
│  │  3  │ └───────────────────┘ │  importance/time
│  └─────┘ ┌───────────────────┐ │
│  ┌─────┐ │         4         │ │  Splash panel for impact
│  │  5  │ └───────────────────┘ │
│  └─────┘                       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Splash Page (1 large panel)**
- Use sparingly for maximum impact
- Epic moments, major reveals, climax
- Full page illustration

### Panel Pacing

**Time Representation:**
- Small panel = quick moment
- Large panel = longer moment or important beat
- Multiple small panels = rapid sequence
- Wide panel = passage of time or panoramic view

**Example Pacing:**
```
Beat: "E frantically tries to save laptop"

Fast Pacing (6 small panels):
[Quick cuts: Hand on power button, water spreading, checking ports, wiping screen, searching for rice, defeated slump]

Slow Pacing (3 large panels):
[Panel 1: E carefully examining laptop]
[Panel 2: Close-up of water damage inside]
[Panel 3: E's face, realizing it's hopeless]
```

## Segment Architecture

### Segment Types

**1. Character-Panel (Primary)**
```json
{
  "type": "character-panel",
  "priority": 1,
  "characters": ["em", "e"],
  "description": "Em shows E her science project, E looks impressed",
  "poses": {
    "em": "holding project proudly, bright expression",
    "e": "leaning in, eyebrows raised, smile"
  },
  "environment": "garage workbench, afternoon light"
}
```

**2. Speech-Bubble**
```json
{
  "type": "speech-bubble",
  "priority": 2,
  "character": "em",
  "dialogue": "Dad, check this out! It's a motion sensor using Arduino!",
  "bubble_style": "excited",
  "position": "upper-right",
  "tail_direction": "em_mouth"
}
```

**3. Thought-Bubble**
```json
{
  "type": "thought-bubble",

  "color": "#FFFFFF",
  "opacity": 0.6
}
```

**6. Border**
```json
{
  "type": "border",
  "priority": 4,

  "priority": 0,
  "description": "suburban garage interior, warm lighting, sunset through window",
  "blur": 0.3,
  "opacity": 0.9
}
```

### Segment Priority

```
Priority 0: Background layer (generated first)
Priority 1: Character panel (main focus)
Priority 2: Text elements (speech, thought, SFX, captions)
Priority 3: Comic effects (motion lines, impact stars)
Priority 4: Border/frame
```

Lower priority = rendered first (background)
Higher priority = rendered last (foreground)

## Visual Storytelling Techniques

### Show, Don't Tell

**Bad:**
```
Caption: "E was very angry at P for destroying his laptop."
```

**Good:**
```
Panel: E's face red, veins on forehead, pointing finger at P who cowers
Speech: "P! THAT WAS THREE HOURS OF WORK!"
P's thought bubble: [whimpering dog face]
```

### Action-to-Action Transitions

**Sequential movement:**
```
Panel 1: Em winds up to throw ball
Panel 2: Em mid-throw, arm extended
Panel 3: Ball flying through air
Panel 4: P jumping to catch
```

### Subject-to-Subject Transitions

**Same scene, different subjects:**
```
Panel 1: E explaining at whiteboard
Panel 2: Em listening, confused expression
Panel 3: P sleeping under table
Panel 4: Back to E, still explaining enthusiastically
```

### Scene-to-Scene Transitions

**Location or time change:**
```
Panel 1: Garage, daytime - "Let's test it tonight."
Panel 2: Same garage, nighttime - characters gathered
```

### Moment-to-Moment Transitions

**Subtle progression:**
```
Panel 1: E's hand reaching for power button
Panel 2: Finger making contact
Panel 3: Button pressed
Panel 4: Screen lights up
```

### Aspect-to-Aspect Transitions

**Building atmosphere:**
```
Panel 1: Garage door, slightly open
Panel 2: Tools on pegboard
Panel 3: Coffee mug on workbench
Panel 4: E coding at laptop
```
