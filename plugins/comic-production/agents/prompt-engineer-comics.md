## Comic Prompt Architecture

### Prompt Structure

```
[Character Identity] + [Appearance Details] + [Pose/Action] + [Environment] + [Style] + [Quality Tags]
```

**Example:**
```
em_character, pre-teen girl, high ponytail, sporty dark blue hoodie, white hi-top sneakers,
standing confidently with hands on hips,
suburban garage interior, afternoon lighting through window,
comic book style, clean lines, vibrant colors, cel shading,
masterpiece, best quality, high resolution
```

### Hierarchical Prompting

**Priority Order:**
1. **Identity** (most important - who)
2. **Appearance** (what they look like)
3. **Pose/Action** (what they're doing)
4. **Environment** (where they are)
5. **Style** (how it should look)
6. **Quality** (technical specs)

## Character Prompt Templates

```

## Scene Prompting

### Environment Templates

```python
ENVIRONMENTS = {
  "garage_day": """suburban garage interior, workbench with tools on pegboard,
    laptop on desk, car equipment visible, afternoon sunlight through window,
    warm lighting, organized chaos""",

  "garage_night": """suburban garage interior, overhead lighting,
    warm yellow glow, tools and equipment, laptop screen glow,
    evening atmosphere, cozy workspace""",

  "living_room": """modern suburban living room, couch, coffee table,
    family photos on walls, warm afternoon light,

}
```

### Lighting & Mood

LIGHTING = {
  "bright_day": "bright natural daylight, high key lighting, cheerful",
  "soft_afternoon": "soft warm afternoon light, golden hour glow",
  "overcast": "diffused cloudy day lighting, even soft light",

  "tense": "darker tones, dramatic lighting, suspenseful mood",
  "warm": "warm color palette, cozy atmosphere, familial comfort",
  "exciting": "dynamic composition, vibrant colors, high energy"
}
```

## Style Prompting

### Comic Style Specifications

```python
COMIC_STYLES = {
  "clean_modern": """comic book style, clean lines, cel shading,
    vibrant colors, smooth gradients, professional comic art,
    digital painting, high detail""",

  "manga_inspired": """manga style, clean linework, screentone effects,

    professional animation quality"""
}

# Style consistency anchors (use same across all panels)
STYLE_ANCHORS = """comic book style, clean lines, vibrant colors,
  cel shading, digital art, high quality"""
```

### Quality & Technical Tags

```python
QUALITY_POSITIVE = """masterpiece, best quality, high resolution,
  professional, detailed, sharp focus, 8k"""

QUALITY_NEGATIVE = """low quality, blurry, distorted, bad anatomy,
  deformed, disfigured, mutation, extra limbs, missing limbs,
  watermark, signature, text, logo, username, artist name,
  jpeg artifacts, compression, pixelated"""
```

## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. Keyword Weighting

```python
# Increase importance of specific elements
# Syntax: (keyword:weight)

prompt = """(em_character:1.3), pre-teen girl, high ponytail,
  (sporty dark blue hoodie:1.2), white sneakers,
  confident stance"""

# Decrease importance
prompt = """em_character, pre-teen girl,
  suburban garage (background:0.8)"""
```

### 2. Negative Prompting Strategy

```python
def build_negative_prompt(character):
    """Build character-specific negative prompt"""

    # Global negatives
    base_negatives = [
        "low quality", "blurry", "distorted", "bad anatomy",
        "deformed", "disfigured", "extra limbs", "missing limbs",
        "watermark", "signature", "text"
    ]

    # Character-specific negatives
    character_negatives = {
        "em": [
            "adult woman", "elderly", "child", "baby",
            "different hairstyle", "long hair", "short hair",
            "dress", "skirt", "formal wear", "heels",
            "makeup", "jewelry", "accessories"
        ],
        "e": [
            "young boy", "teenager", "elderly man",
            "suit", "tie", "formal wear",
            "long hair", "beard", "mustache"
        ]
    }

    all_negatives = base_negatives + character_negatives.get(character, [])
    return ", ".join(all_negatives)
```

### 3. Prompt Anchoring (Consistency)

```python
# Create reusable anchors
CHARACTER_ANCHORS = {
    "em": "em_character, pre-teen girl, high ponytail, sporty dark blue hoodie, white hi-top sneakers",
    "e": "e_character, 30s dad, casual gray hoodie, friendly face",
    "p": "p_character, medium-sized golden-brown dog, floppy ears"
}

STYLE_ANCHOR = "comic book style, clean lines, vibrant colors, cel shading"

def build_panel_prompt(character, expression, pose, scene):
    """Build complete panel prompt with anchors"""
    return f"""{CHARACTER_ANCHORS[character]},
      {EXPRESSIONS[character][expression]},
      {POSES[character][pose]},
      {scene},
      {STYLE_ANCHOR},
      masterpiece, best quality"""
```

### 4. Compositional Prompting

```python
COMPOSITIONS = {
  "rule_of_thirds": "composition rule of thirds, subject positioned at power point",
  "centered": "centered composition, subject in middle, symmetrical",
  "dynamic_diagonal": "dynamic diagonal composition, action flowing",
  "foreground_background": "clear foreground and background separation, depth",
  "close_up_face": "close-up on face, head fills frame, emotional focus",
  "wide_establishing": "wide shot, full environment visible, establishing shot",
  "over_shoulder": "over-the-shoulder angle, conversation perspective"
}

CAMERA_ANGLES = {
  "eye_level": "eye-level camera angle, neutral perspective",
  "low_angle": "low angle looking up, heroic powerful perspective",
  "high_angle": "high angle looking down, vulnerable perspective",
  "dutch_angle": "dutch angle, tilted frame, dynamic tension",
  "worms_eye": "worm's eye view, extreme low angle",
  "birds_eye": "bird's eye view, overhead shot, top-down"
}
```

## Multi-Character Prompting

### Regional Conditioning

```python
def build_multi_character_prompt(characters_with_positions):
    """Build prompt for multiple characters"""

    # Use regional prompting or attention coupling
    regions = []

    for char, position in characters_with_positions.items():
        char_prompt = f"""{CHARACTER_ANCHORS[char]},
          {position['expression']},
          {position['pose']},
          positioned at {position['location']}"""
        regions.append(char_prompt)

    # Combine with scene
    full_prompt = f"""{' AND '.join(regions)},
      {scene_description},
      {STYLE_ANCHOR},
      masterpiece"""

    return full_prompt

# Example usage
prompt = build_multi_character_prompt({
    "em": {
        "expression": "excited",
        "pose": "pointing",
        "location": "left side"
    },
    "e": {
        "expression": "proud",
        "pose": "standing_casual",
        "location": "right side"
    }
})
```

### Sequential Generation (Alternative)

```python
# For complex scenes, generate characters separately then composite

# Step 1: Generate Em
em_prompt = f"""{CHARACTER_ANCHORS['em']}, excited expression,
  pointing gesture, transparent background"""

# Step 2: Generate E
e_prompt = f"""{CHARACTER_ANCHORS['e']}, proud expression,
  standing casual, transparent background"""

# Step 3: Generate background
bg_prompt = f"""{ENVIRONMENTS['garage_day']}, no people, empty scene"""

# Step 4: Composite in post-processing
```

## Prompt Testing & Iteration

### A/B Testing Framework

```python
def test_prompt_variations(base_config, variations):
    """Generate same shot with different prompt variations"""

    results = []

    for variation_name, changes in variations.items():
        config = base_config.copy()
        config.update(changes)

        # Generate
        image = generate_image(config)
        results.append({
            "name": variation_name,
            "config": config,
            "image": image
        })

    return results

# Example: Test different style anchors
variations = {
    "clean_modern": {"style": COMIC_STYLES["clean_modern"]},
    "manga_inspired": {"style": COMIC_STYLES["manga_inspired"]},
    "webcomic": {"style": COMIC_STYLES["webcomic"]}
}

results = test_prompt_variations(base_shot_config, variations)
```

### Prompt Refinement Process

```
1. Start Simple: Basic character + pose + scene
2. Test Generation: Generate and evaluate
3. Add Detail: Incrementally add style, lighting, mood
4. Test Again: Compare with previous version
5. Negative Tuning: Add negatives for unwanted elements
6. Anchor: Lock in working elements
7. Document: Save successful prompts for reuse
```

## Integration Patterns

### Shotlist → Prompt Conversion

```python
def shotlist_to_prompt(shot_spec):
    """Convert shotlist specification to ComfyUI prompt"""

    characters = shot_spec["panel"]["characters"]
    environment = shot_spec["panel"]["environment"]
    camera = shot_spec["panel"]["camera"]
    mood = shot_spec["panel"]["mood"]

    # Build character portion
    char_prompts = []
    for char in characters:
        char_card = load_character_card(f"characters/{char}/card.json")
        char_prompts.append(char_card["base_prompt"])

    character_part = ", ".join(char_prompts)

    # Build scene portion
    scene_part = f"""{environment},
      {camera['shot_type']} shot,
      {camera['angle']} camera angle,
      {camera['framing']}"""

    # Build mood/lighting
    mood_part = f"{mood}, {shot_spec['panel'].get('lighting', '')}"

    # Combine
    full_prompt = f"""{character_part},
      {scene_part},
      {mood_part},
      {STYLE_ANCHOR},
      masterpiece, best quality"""

    return full_prompt
```

### MCP Integration

```javascript
// 1. Render panel with optimized prompts
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__render_panel({
  episodeId: "pilot",
  shotId: "S01",
  // Structured prompt building (recommended)
  characters: ["em", "e"],
  env: "ems-bedroom",
  camera: "medium-wide, rule-of-thirds, eye-level",
  style: "em-e-comics",  // Use style presets
  characterAppearances: [  // Optional overrides for this panel
    {
      character: "em",
      clothing: "pajamas with code patterns",
      notes: "just woke up"
    }
  ],
  width: 768,
  height: 1365,
  provider: "gemini"  // Fast, cheap for testing prompts
})

// 2. Get style presets for prompt optimization
const styles = await mcp__comic_strip_studio__get_style_presets()
// Returns 11 presets with different visual styles

// 3. Test different providers for quality comparison
// Use "gemini" ($0.002) for rapid testing
// Use "consistent" ($0.01) for character-critical shots
// Use "flux" ($0.03) for final hero shots
await mcp__comic_strip_studio__render_panel({
  episodeId: "pilot",
  shotId: "S01",
  prompt: "Pre-teen girl with high ponytail, wearing hoodie, frustrated expression, looking at laptop with error screen, comic book style, clean lines",
  negativePrompt: "blurry, realistic, photograph, multiple heads",
  referenceImage: "characters/references/em_front.png",  // For consistency
  provider: "gemini"
})
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistency is King

```python
# Always use exact same character anchors
# Bad: Different descriptions each time
"girl with ponytail"
"young girl, hair tied up"
"pre-teen with high ponytail"

# Good: Exact same anchor
"em_character, pre-teen girl, high ponytail, sporty dark blue hoodie"
```

### 2. Layered Prompting

```python
# Build complexity gradually
base = "em_character, pre-teen girl"
appearance = "high ponytail, sporty dark blue hoodie, white sneakers"
action = "standing confidently, hands on hips"
scene = "suburban garage, afternoon lighting"
style = "comic book style, clean lines, vibrant colors"
quality = "masterpiece, best quality"

full_prompt = f"{base}, {appearance}, {action}, {scene}, {style}, {quality}"
```

### 3. Negative Prompt Discipline

```python
# Include all potential issues
negatives = """low quality, blurry, bad anatomy, deformed,
  adult, elderly, different outfit, different hairstyle,
  watermark, signature, text"""

# Update negatives based on common issues
# If model often generates extra limbs: add "extra limbs, multiple arms"
# If wrong age: add "adult woman, child, baby"
```

### 4. Test Early, Test Often

- Generate test panels before full episode
- Test character consistency across 5-10 panels
- Verify style remains consistent
- Check for common artifacts
- Document successful prompts

### 5. Version Prompts

```python
# Track prompt versions
PROMPT_VERSIONS = {
  "em_v1": "em_character, pre-teen girl, ponytail, hoodie",
  "em_v2": "em_character, pre-teen girl, high ponytail, sporty dark blue hoodie, white sneakers",
  "em_v3": "em_character, pre-teen girl, 11-13 years old, high ponytail brown hair, sporty dark blue hoodie (#2D6BFF), white hi-top sneakers, athletic build"
}

# Use most recent stable version
CURRENT_EM_PROMPT = PROMPT_VERSIONS["em_v3"]
```

## Prompt Library

```python
# Maintain library of working prompts
PROMPT_LIBRARY = {
  "characters": {
    "em": {...},
    "e": {...},
    "p": {...}
  },
  "scenes": ENVIRONMENTS,
  "styles": COMIC_STYLES,
  "expressions": {...},
  "poses": {...},
  "lighting": LIGHTING,
  "mood": MOOD,
  "compositions": COMPOSITIONS
}

# Export for team use
def export_prompt_library(output_path):
    """Export prompt library as JSON"""
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(PROMPT_LIBRARY, f, indent=2)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Character looks different each panel
- **Fix**: Strengthen InstantID, use exact same character anchor

**Issue**: Wrong outfit keeps appearing
- **Fix**: Add specific outfit to negative prompt, use LoRA trigger word

**Issue**: Style inconsistent
- **Fix**: Use exact same style anchor, same checkpoint model

**Issue**: Background dominates character
- **Fix**: Weight character higher (em_character:1.3), background lower (background:0.8)

**Issue**: Multiple characters blend together
- **Fix**: Use regional prompting, or generate separately and composite
