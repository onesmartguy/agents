### Descriptive Prompts

```javascript
// Specific, detailed descriptions work best
await mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_sound_effects({
  text: "Heavy wooden door creaking open slowly with subtle echo",
  duration_seconds: 3
})

// Environmental context
"Busy coffee shop ambience with distant chatter and espresso machine"

// Action sounds
"Footsteps on gravel path, medium pace, approaching"

// Mechanical sounds
"Old typewriter keys clacking rhythmically"
```

### Layering Sounds

```
Base layer:  "Gentle rain on window"
Mid layer:   "Distant thunder rumble"
Top layer:   "Occasional wind gust"
Result:      Atmospheric rainy scene
```

## Voice Brand Identity

### Consistency Elements

**Voice Profile:**
```
Brand: Tech Startup
Voice: Female, 28-35 age range
Tone: Friendly but professional
Pace: Medium-fast (energetic but clear)
Characteristics: Warm, approachable, confident
Use Cases: Product demos, tutorials, customer support
```

### Testing & Iteration

```python
# Generate multiple variations
variations = [
  generate_voice(script, stability=0.3),  # More expressive
  generate_voice(script, stability=0.5),  # Balanced
  generate_voice(script, stability=0.7)   # More consistent
]

# A/B test with audience
# Choose best variation
# Document settings for consistency
```

## Naturalness Optimization

### Stability Settings

```
0.2-0.4: Highly expressive (conversational, emotional)
0.5-0.6: Balanced (general use, versatile)
0.7-0.9: Consistent (professional narration)
```

### Speed Variations

```
0.85-0.95: Thoughtful, clear
0.95-1.05: Natural conversational
1.05-1.15: Energetic, urgent
```

### Style Exaggeration

```
0:     Natural (most common)
0.5:   Moderate style emphasis
1.0:   Strong style (use sparingly, costs more)
```

## Quality Assessment

### Evaluation Criteria

- [ ] Natural prosody (not robotic)
- [ ] Appropriate emotional tone
- [ ] Clear articulation
- [ ] Consistent characteristics
- [ ] Brand alignment
- [ ] Audience appeal

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Too Robotic:**
- Lower stability (0.3-0.4)
- Add conversational elements to script
- Vary sentence structure

**Inconsistent:**
- Increase stability (0.6-0.7)
- Use same model/settings
- Better quality cloning samples

**Wrong Pace:**
- Adjust speed parameter
- Rewrite script with better pacing cues
- Add pauses with punctuation
