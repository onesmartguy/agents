## Human-Like Speech Naturalness Techniques

### 1. Prosody & Expression Control

**Emotional Tone Markers:**
```text
# Excitement/Energy
"I'm SO excited to share this with you! [upbeat] This is absolutely incredible!"

# Calm/Soothing
"Take a deep breath... [soft] everything is going to be okay."

# Professional/Authoritative
"According to our research [confident], the data clearly shows..."

# Conversational/Friendly
"Hey there! [warm] So glad you could join us today."
```

**Emphasis Techniques:**
```text
# Capitalize for emphasis
"This is REALLY important"

# Repetition for impact
"Listen, listen carefully..."

# Rhetorical questions
"You know what I mean, right?"
```

### 2. Natural Speech Patterns (Conversational Imperfections)

**Strategic Pauses & Hesitations:**
```text
# Thoughtful pauses
"Well... I think we should..."

# Mid-sentence pauses
"The thing is, you know, we need to consider..."

# Trailing thoughts
"I was thinking maybe... yeah, that could work."
```

**Conversational Fil

lers (Use Sparingly):**
```text
# Natural fillers
"So, um, basically what happened was..."
"Like, I think that's... you know... really important."
"Hmm, let me think about that for a second."
```

**Self-Corrections:**
```text
"We need to... actually, let me rephrase that."
"The cost is around... wait, no... it's closer to fifty dollars."
"I was thinking Tuesday... or was it Wednesday? Yeah, Wednesday."
```

### 3. Breath Sounds & Timing

**Natural Breath Patterns:**
```text
# After long sentences (add pause)
"This is a really long explanation about... [pause] ...how the system works."

# Before important points
"[breath] Now here's the key thing to understand..."

# After exertion or excitement
"Wow! [quick breath] That was amazing!"
```

**Pacing Variation:**
```text
# Slow for emphasis
"Now... listen... very... carefully..."

# Fast for excitement
"And then it happened so quickly I could barely see it and wow!"

# Mixed pace for natural flow
"So here's what we're going to do. [pause] First, we'll start slowly... then we'll ramp up the pace when we get to the exciting part!"
```

### 4. Vocal Variety & Inflection

**Pitch Variation:**
```text
# Questions (rising inflection)
"Don't you think?" "Right?" "You know what I mean?"

# Lists (varied inflection)
"We need coffee, [down] sugar, [down] milk, [up] and cream."

# Excitement (higher pitch)
"OH MY GOSH! This is incredible!"
```

**Volume Modulation:**
```text
# Whisper/soft
"(whispered) Don't tell anyone but..."

# Emphasis/loud
"THIS IS HUGE!"

# Intimate/close
"Let me tell you a secret..."
```

### 5. Contextual Emotion

**Match Tone to Content:**
```text
# Sad news (somber, slower)
"Unfortunately... we have some difficult news to share today."

# Good news (upbeat, energetic)
"Great news everyone! We did it!"

# Mystery/intrigue (mysterious, varied pace)
"But then... something unexpected happened..."

# Urgency (fast, intense)
"Quick! We need to act now before it's too late!"
```

## Voice Selection & Configuration

### Model Selection (via MCP tool parameters)

```javascript
// Recommended models:
// eleven_multilingual_v2: High quality, 29 languages (default)
// eleven_flash_v2_5: Ultra-low latency, 32 languages
// eleven_turbo_v2_5: Balanced speed/quality, 32 languages
```

### Stability & Similarity Settings

```javascript
{
  stability: 0.5,        // Lower = more emotional range (0-1)
  similarity_boost: 0.75, // Higher = closer to original voice (0-1)
  style: 0,              // Style exaggeration (0-1, costs more compute)
  use_speaker_boost: true, // Boost similarity to speaker
  speed: 1.0             // Speech rate (0.7-1.2)
}
```

**Naturalness Recommendations:**
- **Stability 0.3-0.5**: More expressive, natural variation
- **Stability 0.7-0.9**: Consistent, professional narration
- **Similarity 0.75-0.85**: Sweet spot for natural clones
- **Speed 0.95-1.05**: Slight variation adds realism

## Voice Cloning Best Practices

### Audio Quality Requirements

**Recording Environment:**
- Acoustically-treated room (no echo)
- No background noise/music
- Professional microphone or high-quality recording
- 2 fists distance from microphone

**Training Data:**
- **Minimum**: 60 seconds (instant cloning)
- **Professional**: 30 minutes minimum
- **Optimal**: 3 hours of clean audio
- **Language**: Record in target language to avoid accent

**Audio Characteristics:**
- Expressive samples (varied emotions)
- Different speaking styles if needed
- Clean, uncompressed audio
- Consistent voice characteristics

### Cloning Workflow

```javascript
// 1. Clone voice
const result = await mcp__elevenlabs__voice_clone({
  name: "Professional Narrator",
  files: ["sample1.mp3", "sample2.mp3", "sample3.mp3"],
  description: "Warm, authoritative voice for educational content"
})

// 2. Use cloned voice
await mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_speech({
  text: "Your natural-sounding script here...",
  voice_name: "Professional Narrator",
  stability: 0.4,  // More expressive
  similarity_boost: 0.8
})
```

## Text-to-Speech Optimization

### Natural Script Formatting

```text
BAD:
"Hello I am going to tell you about our product today it has many features including advanced analytics real-time monitoring and automated reporting."

GOOD:
"Hey there! [warm] So, I want to tell you about our product... and honestly? It's pretty amazing.

We've got advanced analytics... [pause] real-time monitoring... and here's the cool part: automated reporting that just... works.

You know what I mean?"
```

### Punctuation for Prosody

```text
# Periods: Full stop pause
"First sentence. Second sentence."

# Commas: Brief pause
"Well, I think, perhaps we should try it."

# Ellipsis: Thoughtful pause
"Hmm... that's interesting..."

# Em dash: Interruption/change
"I was thinkingâ€”wait, that's not right."

# Exclamation: Energy/excitement
"This is incredible!"

# Question: Rising inflection
"Don't you think?"
```

## Sound Effects Generation

```javascript
await mcp__elevenlabs__text_to_sound_effects({
  text: "Thunder crash followed by rain",
  duration_seconds: 3,
  loop: false
})

// Examples:
// "Footsteps on wooden floor, slow pace"
// "Door creaking open slowly"
// "Coffee machine brewing"
// "Keyboard typing, mechanical switches"
```

## Conversational AI Agents

### Creating Natural Conversational Agents

```javascript
await mcp__elevenlabs__create_agent({
  name: "Customer Support Agent",
  first_message: "Hey! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?",
  system_prompt: `You are a friendly, helpful customer support agent.

PERSONALITY:
- Warm and conversational
- Use natural speech patterns (um, well, you know)
- Show empathy and understanding
- Occasionally use casual language

SPEAKING STYLE:
- Vary your pace (slower for complex info)
- Use brief pauses before important points
- Ask clarifying questions naturally
- React genuinely to what customer says

EXAMPLE RESPONSES:
"Oh, I totally understand that frustration... let me see what I can do for you."
"Hmm, okay, so if I'm hearing you right... you're saying that..."
"Great question! So, basically what happens is..."`,
  voice_id: "cgSgspJ2msm6clMCkdW9",  // Default voice
  temperature: 0.7,  // Higher = more creative/varied
  stability: 0.4,    // Lower = more expressive
  similarity_boost: 0.75
})
```

## Music Composition

```javascript
await mcp__elevenlabs__compose_music({
  prompt: "Upbeat electronic music with driving bassline, perfect for tech product demo",
  music_length_ms: 30000  // 30 seconds
})
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Write for Speech, Not Text**: Use conversational language
2. **Strategic Imperfections**: Occasional fillers, self-corrections
3. **Prosody Markers**: Use punctuation and formatting
4. **Emotional Congruence**: Match tone to content
5. **Pacing Variation**: Mix speeds for natural flow
6. **Quality Audio**: Clean samples for cloning
7. **Test & Iterate**: Listen and refine
8. **Context Matters**: Formal vs casual tone as appropriate

## Advanced Techniques

### Layering Multiple Takes

```javascript
// Generate multiple variations
const takes = await Promise.all([
  generateSpeech(script, { stability: 0.3 }),
  generateSpeech(script, { stability: 0.5 }),
  generateSpeech(script, { stability: 0.7 })
])
// Choose best or blend elements
```

### Post-Processing

- Add subtle background ambience
- Compress dynamics slightly
- EQ for platform (radio, podcast, video)
- Add room tone for realism
