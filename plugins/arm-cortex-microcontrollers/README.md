### Works Well With


### Integration Patterns

- **Sequential workflows:** Chain multiple agents for complex tasks
- **Parallel execution:** Run independent agents simultaneously
- **Context sharing:** Maintain state across agent interactions

## Best Practices

### Do's

- Use `@arm-cortex-expert` for primary tasks in this domain
- Follow the plugin's specialized patterns for languages
- Leverage progressive disclosure skills for advanced features
- Combine with complementary plugins for full-stack workflows

### Don'ts

- Don't use this plugin for tasks outside its domain
- Avoid mixing incompatible plugin patterns
- Don't skip the recommended workflow steps

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-complexity:** Start simple, add features incrementally
2. **Wrong agent:** Use the right agent for the task
3. **Missing context:** Provide sufficient background information

### Optimization Tips

- Use progressive disclosure to load only needed knowledge
- Cache agent responses when appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Agent not responding as expected

**Solution:**
- Verify plugin installation
- Check agent name spelling
- Provide more context in your request

**Issue:** Skill not activating

**Solution:**
- Ensure trigger criteria match your use case
- Explicitly mention the skill in your request

### Error Messages


| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Agent not found | Plugin not installed | Verify installation |
| Skill unavailable | Path mismatch | Check skill directory structure |
| Command failed | Missing dependencies | Review prerequisites |

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Verbose mode:** Request detailed explanations from agents
2. **Step-by-step:** Break complex tasks into smaller steps
3. **Isolation:** Test agents individually before combining
