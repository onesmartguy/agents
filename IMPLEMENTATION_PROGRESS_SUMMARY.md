## Implementation Strategy Going Forward

### Recommended Approach: Template-Based

Now that `react-pro.md` is complete, it can serve as a template for other agents:

1. **Use react-pro.md as template** for similar complexity agents
2. **Adapt structure** for each agent's specific domain
3. **Maintain consistency** in format, sections, and code examples
4. **Focus on unique value** - what makes each agent special

### Batch Implementation

Rather than completing one plugin at a time, consider batch implementation:

**Day 1-2: All Agents**
- Write all 19 agents using templates
- Ensures consistency across plugins
- Faster to establish patterns

**Day 3-4: All Commands**
- Create all 7 scaffold commands
- Similar structure across all
- Can reuse scaffolding patterns

**Day 5-6: All Skills**
- Write all 38 SKILL.md files
- Progressive disclosure pattern
- Reference documentation structure

**Day 7-8: Testing & Documentation**
- Integration testing
- Plugin READMEs
- CLAUDE.md updates

- [ ] All agents have proper frontmatter (name, description, model)
- [ ] Description includes "Use PROACTIVELY" trigger criteria
- [ ] Code examples are complete and working
- [ ] TypeScript types are included
- [ ] Testing examples provided
- [ ] Skills use progressive disclosure pattern
- [ ] Skills have "Use when" activation criteria
- [ ] Commands provide complete scaffolding
- [ ] All markdown is properly formatted
- [ ] No broken internal links

### Marketplace Integration:
- [ ] Correct paths in marketplace.json
- [ ] Valid JSON syntax
- [ ] Proper keywords for discoverability
- [ ] Correct category assignments
- [ ] Version numbers consistent (1.2.2)

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Continue with react-development agents**
   - Create `react-query-pro.md` using react-pro as template
   - Create `react-testing-pro.md`

2. **Create one complete skill as template**
   - Implement `react-hooks-mastery/SKILL.md`
   - Establish progressive disclosure pattern
   - Use for other 37 skills

3. **Create one complete command as template**
   - Implement `react-scaffold.md`
   - Complete project generation with examples
   - Use for other 6 commands

4. **Then batch remaining components**
   - Use templates to speed up implementation
   - Maintain quality and consistency

## Token Usage

**Session Usage:** ~127K tokens used
**Remaining:** ~73K tokens
**Recommendation:** Continue in new session for batch implementation
